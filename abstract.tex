Due to their omnipresence, mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablets could be of tremendous value to research. 
However, since research projects can use these devices to collect 
data that reveals personal information, there are substantial
privacy concerns with mobile device use. Therefore, researchers must go through 
a detailed IRB process before recruiting participants.
As such, many research studies either do not use data from real participants or use
data collected from a tightly controlled and non-representative subset of
participants. %often university students.
%such as investigating end-user traffic patterns, etc. 
%However, the expanded use of mobile 
%devices has resulted in increased privacy and security break-ins 
%on these devices. Therefore, many research institutions require that 
%research on mobile devices must be conducted in a responsible 
%and ethical manner. %challenging for researchers to 
%%conduct research on these devices without compromising
%%the privacy of device owners. 
%This poses challenges to the existing mobile testbeds that 
%play an important role in evaluating network research ideas. 
%The question remains whether research on 
%mobile devices can be carried out using a network testbed, without causing breaches of 
%personal privacy and device security. 

In this paper we present Sensibility Testbed, an experiment  
platform that lowers the policy and technical barriers to performing 
experiments on end users' mobile devices.

Data can be gathered

%Sensibility Testbed provides privacy protection of mobile device 
%data, and maintains the security of device systems from 
%potentially buggy experiment code. The experiment code in Sensibility 
%Testbed runs in isolated sandboxes to 
%prevent inadvertent or malicious bugs. 
Access to sensor data on a mobile device is mediated according to the policies 
set by the institutional review board (IRB) of the researcher's 
institution. These policies are enforced by Sensibility Testbed via technical 
means, not just as stated policies, by a set of non-bypassable 
\textit{blurring layers}. 
Different policies can be created by customizing individual blurring layers 
and loading and stacking them in order on a device. 
These technical innovations simplify the IRB process and allow Sensibility 
Testbed to cater to a wider range of participants. Furthermore, 
Sensibility Testbed's platform design saves researchers' 
effort in recruiting participants and managing a deployment.
