\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present Sensibility Testbed, a secure, privacy-conscious
experimental and research platform running on personal mobile
computing devices such as smartphones. Sensibility Testbed's platform
design approach encourages reusing not only experiment code and
infrastructure, but also saves efforts on managing a deployment and
recruiting participants.

Furthermore, Sensibility Testbed maintains device safety and privacy
of participants: Experimenters' code is running in isolated sandboxes;
access to sensor values is limited using a combination of blurring
and rate-limiting. This allows Sensibility Testbed to cater to an
audience of participants beyond that of previous campus-only,
incentivized testbeds, thereby adding to the diversity of the
installed base in terms of participating devices, OS software
versions, network operators, participant demographics, countries,
etc.

Sensibility Testbed's implementation is available for public
experimentation at \url{...}.
