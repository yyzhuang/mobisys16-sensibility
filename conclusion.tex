\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclude}

In this paper we introduced a new technology that can make it easier for 
researchers to take advantage of of the rich data gathering potential of 
portable devices. By enabling programmable enforcement of IRB-approved privacy 
policies through the control of sensor access, Sensibility Testbed is able to greatly 
reduce the workload on researchers, who no longer need to have a "hands-on"
role in policy enforcement. Based on a study of the literature, Sensibility Testbed
can protect device owners from most of the security and privacy issues identified
in previous projects using mobile devices. The greatly reduced risk of participation
for device owners thus encourages the development of a larger and more diverse pool 
of test subjects.
