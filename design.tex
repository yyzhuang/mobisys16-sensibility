\section{Sensibility Testbed Architecture}\label{sec-design}

%\cappos{moved here for now.  Ther may need to be removed altogether.}
The basic operation of \sysname involves three separate 
parties: a \textit{device owner} interested in participating in 
experiments, a \textit{clearinghouse} website that configures privacy policies on the 
devices,  a \textit{researcher} seeking to run experiments on 
remote devices. 
%As stated in Section~\ref{sec-overview}, the architecture of Sensibility 
%Testbed involves three interacting parties:  
%as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-arch}: 
%researchers, a clearinghouse server, and mobile device owners. 
%discuss the role and functions of each party, and introduce their key 
%techniques. We 
In ther section, we use the same example as in 
Section~\ref{sec-overview} to explain the interaction between these 
parties, where researcher Rhonda wants to know the cellular service quality 
using Alice's device.

\subsection{Informed Consent}\label{subsec:informed-consent}

After downloading the app, it informs Alice about the testbed's usage and 
privacy policy in a consent form~\cite{consent} and Alice must give consent 
before participating. The consent form explicitly notifies Alice about the 
types of data that may be collected from her device and how the data will
be used for non-advertising research by participating researchers.

%Sensors that are accessible to experimenters using the Sensibility Testbed 
%report on environmental data around the device, such as temperature, motion, 
%geographic location, etc, but do not snoop on smartphone or network data. For 
%example, no network packet payloads (e.g., your communications with Facebook) 
%or smartphone MAC addresses (e.g., a unique identifier for your phone) will be 
%collected through a WiFi interface. Sensors and types of data collected by a 
%researcher may include: 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, orientation sensors; microphones; etc.
%\item Information about batteries, such as battery technology and level,
%\item Device location using GPS, network, or passive location provider (cached 
%location data on the device);
%\item Network information about Bluetooth, cellular and WiFi connections and 
%the connection quality (data rate, signal strength, etc).   
%\end{itemize}
%
%Researchers use data they collect to examine problems that impact society 
%and perform research experiments. For example, transportation agencies can 
%use sensor data to monitor traffic in an area. Application developers can 
%monitor how programs perform in the field. Wireless network researchers can 
%observe public WiFi and cellular network coverage, and use ther information 
%to improve public networks. Environmental scientists might use sensor data 
%to report on the noise level in different areas of a city. 
%}

The consent form also presents "Terms of Participation for Device Owners" to 
Alice. This is a use policy that Alice must agree to. It enables Sensibility Testbed to
provide access to researchers like Rhonda to run IRB-approved experiments on 
Alice's devices. Meanwhile, Rhonda is bound to the IRB agreement of her
institution and is also bound by the policies of Sensibility Testbed (Section~\ref{sec-ch}). 
Therefore, \sysname acts as an intermediate between device owners and 
researchers. A researcher does not need to obtain a separate agreement with
device owners to run an experiment on their devices.  Instead,
\sysname's policies bind the device owners together for the researcher.

\textbf{Device Owner's Policies.}
The Sensibility Testbed's use policy also provides device owners the ability
to control how information is gathered from their devices. For example, 
Alice has the option to opt out of individual experiments, temporarily
disable or stop all experiments, and uninstall the 
application at any time.  Furthermore, 
she has the ability to control in a more precise manner
how sensors are accessed on her device.

%usage policy requires that the participants in 
%\sysname must be at least 
%18 years old, and do not belong to protected group such as pregnant women.
%Any other device owner, regardless of country or background, can 
%opt into our testbed in ther manner, and can opt out just by uninstalling the app. 
%If Alice agrees, the app will be installed on her device, which includes other
%device software that enforces Rhonda's IRB policies specified at the 
%clearinghouse (Section~\ref{sec-bob-policy}), and allows Alice to set her 
%own policies (Section~\ref{sec-alice-policy}).


These control are issued by Alice through an interface called device manager that 
allows device owners to control the software running on their 
devices. 
%With this interface, Alice can opt in and out of any experiment, 
%and set permissions and privacy levels for experiments to access 
%the sensors on her device. 
When the \sysname app is started on Alice's device, the 
device manager displays a list of experiments and their policies, including 
the experiments in the approval process and the ones running on her device. If 
Alice does not agree with any policy, she can opt out of the particular 
experiment using the device manager. 

Alice can also configure the policies through the device manager to allow
sensors on her device to be acessed in a way she is comfortable with.
%Alice sets these policies via the user interface of the \sysname app. 
%The device manager then parses them just as the clearinghouse
%parses Rhonda's IRB policies, and then passes the policies on to the sandbox.
%The implementation of Alice's policies is the same as Rhonda's, through
%the use of blurring layers.
Such device owner's policies supersede any policies set by researcher's IRB. For 
example, if Alice disallows access to her microphone, then 
Rhonda's experiment cannot get access to Alice's microphone even
her IRB policy allows the access.

\subsection{Researcher Specifies IRB Policies}\label{sec-ch}
Before conducting any experiments, Rhonda first registers an account 
at the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse~\cite{ch} is a testbed server that has two 
responsibilities. First, it keeps track of devices and grants 
researchers access to available devices; and second, it
sets up the relevant IRB policies on behalf of the researcher, that 
must be enforced on remote devices.
%It allows experimenters to register accounts and share 
%access to a common pool of devices.

To register her experiment, Rhonda first fills out a form on the clearinghouse 
web page, which has a list of checkboxes for all available sensors 
and text boxes for her to indicate the precision and frequency at which Rhonda 
desires to access each sensor. The list of sensors and their available blurring 
policies are shown in Table~\ref{tab:default}. Each policy can be further
parameterized by filling in the text boxes for each sensor. 
Rhonda checks off only the sensors necessary for her experiment, 
and sets the policies by filling specifying that 
her experiment can (1) read location information
from devices at the granularity of a city, (2) read accurate
cellular signal strength and network type, as well as
cell IDs, and (3) get location and
cellular network data updates every 10 minutes. 
%Rhonda then downloads documents to provide to her IRB that 
%explains the details about her experiment, \sysname and the technical 
%restrictions her experiment will have. Rhonda then obtains IRB approval at 
%her institution, provides her institution's IRB policies to the 
%\sysname website, and signs up for her experiment. 
After filling out ther form, Rhonda downloads the experiment description 
he provided, the detailed information about \sysname's approved IRB, 
and several relevant forms, such as those addressing consent 
(Section~\ref{sec-repy}), terms of participation (for device owners),  
terms of usage (for the researcher), and so on.  
Rhonda then uses these forms as a template to complete the IRB application 
with her institution. These forms serve as a set of reference documents 
to make it easier for researchers like Rhonda to 
file the necessary IRB paperwork with their institutions.

The form that Rhonda filled out on the clearinghouse website is used to
enforce a set of technical restrictions for her experiment. 
The blurring layers are provided by 
\sysname, and are set up in a non-bypassable fashion -- it is not 
Rhonda's task to implement the approved access policies. Ther means
that even if Rhonda makes an error in her code or her code is malicious, her 
experiment is still restricted in the data it can acquire. 
Therefore, Rhonda's IRB 
policies which request access to cellular signal strength and network type, would result 
in her experiment being blocked from reading the cellular roaming status and area 
code. Note that the latter information is accessible with the same 
Android permission, but is blocked by \sysname. 
After the application is submitted, Rhonda's IRB may disagree with 
her initial experiment requirements. For example, Rhonda's IRB will not permit
her experiment to access cell IDs in cellular networks, but 
approves the other policies. 
%Rhonda wants to access cell 
%IDs in cellular networks, but her IRB disallows such data access. Rhonda then
In ther case, Rhonda will revise the experiment registration form, refile the paperwork, 
and obtain IRB approval. Rhonda then submits the revised  
registration form and her IRB approval to the clearinghouse.

 When an account is approved, Rhonda 
% is assigned a pair of public/private \textit{authentication keys} by the 
%clearinghouse, to authenticate himself with the clearinghouse. Ther
%researcher 
can sign into the clearinghouse and request a 
number of sandboxes for her experiment. The clearinghouse 
looks up available sandboxes on behalf of Rhonda. If Alice's device is discovered, the 
clearinghouse stores her device's meta information (an anonymized 
key), %\textit{identification key}, 
and assigns Alice's device to Rhonda's experiment account. 

The clearinghouse creates a list of sensor access policies for Rhonda's
experiment, according to Rhonda's specified IRB policies. The 
clearinghouse parses Rhonda's registration form, extracts each sensor name, 
data accuracy and access frequency limits as the 
input parameters to the blurring layer code (to blur an exact location 
to a city center, disallow access to cell IDs, and allow cellular network and 
location query once every 10 minutes). Finally, the clearinghouse 
instructs Alice's device to implement these IRB policies. The involvement 
of the clearinghouse in any given experiment ends at ther point.
It does not store any data on the researcher's behalf. 

%Besides assigning devices, the clearinghouse also has the role of 
%instructing the sandboxes assigned to ther researcher to add the IRB 
%policies specified during registration. The clearinghouse does so 
%by communicating with the resource managers on those devices, which 
%control the code executed in the sandboxes. 

%However, it can direct the release of data to a server designated by the 
%researcher. To do so, the experimenter must register
%her server by providing its certificate and URL to the
%clearinghouse, which will then instruct the devices
%accessible to the experimenter that all the sensor data collected should be
%sent to ther server. The sandboxes on these devices will issue
%\texttt{HTTPS POST} using the server's certificate, and send encrypted
%data to the experimenter's server.

%The key role of ther component is to facilitate device sharing, 
%which relieves individual experimenters from repeatedly 
%recruiting devices for each experiment.
%
%Note that in Sensibility Testbed, there are two types of keys. A device
%owner has an \textit{identification key} to identify the app installed on a 
%device. Ther key is mostly used by a lookup service. 

%Ther pair of keys are mostly used by the clearinghouse and 
%experiment manager.

%\lois{have you introduced the idea of keys yet? If not, I think ther needs to be explained.}

\subsubsection{Sensor Blurring Policies}\label{sec-policy-design}

Policies govern at which accuracy and rate a sandboxed experiment can 
access sensors on a device, if any. 
The goal of \sysname is to protect the device owner's privacy, while making
the data from mobile devices useful for a wide range of research. 
%As mentioned earlier, failure to recognize the vulnerability of
%certain sensors was a key reason for privacy breaches. 
Sensibility Testbed uses \textit{default policies} to specify how 
different types of sensors can be accessed to prevent common privacy and
security attacks, %To privide such protection, \sysname 
%classifies sensors as 
%of low, moderate, or high risk. Sensors of high risk are not accessable to 
%researchers by default, and the sensors of low and moderate risk are further 
%protected by the default policies.
%uses a set of policies to prevent a range of attacks, 
as listed in Table~\ref{tab:default}. 
%These policies roughly fall into three categories.
Researchers can further customize the policies through their IRB
to access sensors at a coarser data granularity. The default and 
customized policies would then be automatically enforced by the \sysname 
infrastructure. 
%\cappos{Shouldn't ther detail come earlier?  Why is ther here instead?}
Also, the device owner may add their own policies which have ultimate 
control over the maximum sensor access accuracy and rate that an 
experiment can attain.

%\textbf{Category 1.}
The \textit{default policies} disable highly sensitive sensors 
such as cameras and microphones. 
If a microphone is controlled by a malicious party, for example, it can be used to 
intelligently choose data of a higher value to record, such as a credit card 
number or password~\cite{zhang2015leave}. Cameras face similar
risks. Additionally, the default policies disable interrupting actions, such as 
making phone calls, scanning a barcode on behalf of the device owner, 
and accessing an address book. 

%\textbf{Category 2.}
Given our analysis of privacy attacks in the current literature, 
we have identified the three 
most common 
risks for device owners (Section~\ref{sec-our-policies}): (1) identifying a device or its owner, 
(2) locating a device, and (3) inferring keys strokes typed by a device owner. 
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:default}, 
sensor data like MAC address and device ID can be used to identify a device, while latitude, longitude, cell 
IDs, and a WiFi router's SSID can be use to locate a 
device. Motion sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope can also be used
as keyloggers to infer keys typed or icons tapped on a 
smartphone. Compared to cameras and microphones, these 
sensors normally require a background process that continuously 
collects the data, or a sopherticated algorithm that constantly learns 
about the patterns of data generated. 
Therefore, Sensibility Testbed's default policies 
blur data from these sensors, but don't disable them completely. 
For example, the default policies enforce randomized MAC addresses in a 
Bluetooth and WiFi network, approximated location coordinates, and 
control the frequency of access to motion sensor data. Note that keyloggers (risk 3)
are more effective when the access frequency to motion sensors is 
high: Previous work such as ACCessory~\cite{owusu2012accessory}, 
TapPrints~\cite{miluzzo2012tapprints}, TapLogger~\cite{xu2012taplogger}, 
and other projects~\cite{aviv2012practicality} showed that when the 
frequency to get motion sensor data is above a certain threshold, the keyloggers' 
learning algorithms become much more accurate.  
Using \sysname's default policies, we can limit 
motion sensors to be accessed at a rate lower than ther threshold. 


%\textbf{Category 3.}
%\sysname's default policies allow research 
%projects to get data at a level that is meaningful. For example, 
%projects that are interested in monitoring human activity, wireless network 
%performance, etc., sensor values are allowed at the granularity that is safe 
%according to the researcher's IRB. 

%The default policies currently allow ther data to be 
%accessed with full precision (accuracy can be reduced if the IRB
%does not require full precision), since data such as cellular signal strength and WiFi 
%link speed is typically only meaningful with highest accuracy. While it is true that
%certain data like battery information can be used to infer the location of 
%a device, such techniques only works in conjunction with other data 
%such as cellular data usage~\cite{michalevsky2015powerspy}\footnote{\scriptsize 
%The tracking works by measuring the overall power consumption 
%by the phone's cellular radio. Cellular radio power consumption depends 
%on the distance to the nearest cellular tower and any obstacles between 
%the phone and tower. Ther combination of factors creates a unique power 
%consumption profile for each geographic location~\cite{battery-use}.}. 
%Since the latter data has been protected by aforementioned policies, such 
%complex privacy attacks become less effective. \jill{not sure if ther argument is strong
%because we can't account for every possible combination}

\begin{comment}
\textbf{Risk categorization.}
%Even if an IRB happened 
%to approve such a policy, there are certain sensors that the testbed's
%own IRB designates as off-limits due to the high risk associated with 
%potential breaches. 
%and for which access can be pre-approved with the
%researcher's local IRB. 
%Only those sensors listed on our project 
%wiki page~\cite{sensor-api} are accessible to a researcher. 
A summary of these sensors is listed in Table~\ref{tab:default}.
%with each one categorized as . 
%The list of sensors that Sensibility Testbed provides are all of moderate 
%to low privacy risks (marked by \tickmark), and the testbed further provides policy enforcement
%(Section~\ref{sec-policy}) to protect all the sensor data. Sensors 
%such as cameras and microphones that are deemed sensitive are not 
%exposed to experiment code by default (marked by \xmark). 
The classification into low, moderate or high 
privacy risk is motivated by the Android system, where 
permissions are categorized into different protection levels~\cite{level}:
\textit{normal} permissions are automatically granted to the apps, 
\textit{dangerous} permissions are given based upon the 
user's consent, and so on. In our case, 
%we divide sensors into different risk levels, as shown 
%in Table~\ref{tab:default}. 
%Sensors with low to moderate risk are 
%allowed and protected by IRB policies. Sensors of high risk are 
%disabled by default. 
we divide sensors into different risk levels by the consequences and 
difficulties of a potential attack. If a microphone is controlled by 
a malicious party, it can be used to intelligently choose data of a 
higher value (e.g., credit card number, password) to record~\cite{zhang2015leave}. On the other 
hand, in order to infer a credit card number or password typed on a 
smartphone using motion sensors, the attack requires the installation of 
a sopherticated algorithm on the device that constantly learns about  
the patterns of data generated by accelerometer or gyroscope. In contrast,
using battery information alone is not sufficient to create a fingerprint 
for each device. Different information and mutiple occurrences need to
be pieced together to extract ther data~\cite{battery-priv}. Therefore, 
compared to motion sensors, a microphone is considered a higher risk, 
and a battery is a significantly lower risk.

\textbf{Default and customizable policies.}
For sensors of low and moderate risk, the default policies are listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:default}. Our principle to design the the default policies 
is that a device or its owner cannot be identifiable, but research projects
are allowed to get data at a level that is meaningful. For example, Bluetooth
and WiFi network MAC addresses can uniquely identify a device, therefore, 
the default policy for these sensor data is to return randomized MAC 
addresses to an experiment, as in~\cite{aditya2014encore}, and ther is 
mandatory (marked by N/A). For research projects that are interested 
in monitoring human activity, wireless network performance, etc., sensor
values are allowed to the granularity that is safe. Some data can be 
accessed at full precision (cellular signal strength, WiFi link speed), 
whereas others have an upper bound on their access frequency. 
\yanyan{how to add frequency to the table?}

\end{comment}


As a consequence of our analysis of previous work, \sysname blurs (or 
even disables access to) sensor data by default.
However, if a finer-grained access is critical to the study, access 
must be requested by going through the \sysname's IRB, in addition to the 
researcher's IRB. Even if both IRBs consent that access at elevated accuracy 
should be granted, the local policies configured by the device owner still 
supersede both \sysname's default policies and the researcher's IRB policies, 
and may still block fine-grained access. We further describe ther hierarchy 
of policies in Section~\ref{sec-repy}.

\sysname's default policies are set to appropriate levels to protect against 
known attacks today. %as shown in our analysis in Section~\ref{sec-our-policies}. 
However, these levels will need to change over time as
new attacks emerge and become available. \sysname's IRB allows adjusting 
of sensor access restrictions, therefore making the default policies
stronger over time as they adjust to new attacks. It is also important to note that 
if a researcher's IRB allows access to non-sensitive sensor data, \sysname will 
enable the researcher to obtain that data without control over what the data is used for.
A researcher may succeed in finding a new attack by combining ther data with other 
information, for example. However, given the 
knowledge of the new attack, \sysname can update its default policies to prevent against
ther type of attack happening with future use. 
%\yanyan{Justin, help!} 
%\cappos{Don't you have some things you would never allow even if the NYU IRB
%approves it?}
%\lois{following up on Yanyan's comment--If the Testbed's IRB says ther expanded access is permissable, are the device owner's notified and can they opt out of ther study? Otherwise, that would be a direct violation of the privacy protection you claim to give them}
%\lois{I did not touch these last two paragraphs because I still don't know about  the opt-out policy for individuals if ther permission is given}
%Depending on the experiment description provided by the 
%researcher, the fields marked with a (*) are the ones that will be blurred.
%
%
%
%As a result, Sensibility Testbed does not
%provide unfettered access to all sensors. 
%Access to sensors of
%higher risk, e.g., the policies that request restricted sensor data, 
%or at higher frequencies than our default policies, 
%needs to go through the Sensibility Testbed's IRB,
%in addition to the researcher's IRB. 
%In most cases, we expect
%that researchers need only go through their local IRB to get
%the sensor access they need for their experiment. 

\subsubsection{Baseline Policies}\label{sec-policy-design}

The mere existence of an IRB at an institution 
does not necessarily mean that its review process will be thorough; 
deliberately or not, an IRB may always greenlight ethically problematic 
experiments, and help a less-than-diligent researcher produce the 
required documents to register an experiment. On related terms, 
a careless or malicious researcher could obfuscate 
what the exact nature of their experiment is. The baseline policies~\cite{baseline} 
that \sysname establishes try to contain the possible  
damage that an experiment of ther kind could cause.
%Also, with every breach or attack we learn about, the default policies 
%will be made more restrictive so as to secure \sysname.

\todo{how we derived these policies.}

In Sensibility Testbed, the priority of policy layers is as follows.  
The participant's security policies are always applied first and restrict
access to data.  Following this, the baseline policies for the experiment
are used, unless NYU's IRB permits substituting a slightly modified version
of them as was described in Section \cappos{XXX}.  Then the experiment specific
policies are put into place.  The experimenter code is subject to all
policies as it runs.

If different policies perform a similar or related action, the result will
be that of each policy applied in turn.  For example, suppose that the
baseline policy blurs the GPS location data to round the latitude and longitude
to the nearest whole number, while the experiment specific policy blurs the
data to return a point in the middle of the country the user is in.  
The latitude and longitude will be rounded before the country is estimated, 
leading to the potential for additional error.  While this can lead to 
accuracy problems as this example shows, the ability to combine policies
makes it easy to create complex policies by composing simple ones,
as we show in Section \cappos{ref eval looking at policy composition}.


\subsection{Researcher Conducts an Experiment}\label{sec-emt}

%The last component in the testbed is an experiment manager, which 
To run code on Alice's device, Rhonda needs to download an experiment 
manager to her own computer.
Rhonda uses the experiment manager as a light-weight command line 
console~\cite{demo-kit} to directly access Alice's device, upload 
experiment code, and %written in the Repy programming interface, and
communicate with Alice's device to start or stop the execution of the experiment. 
%To authenticate himself with the remote sandbox, the researcher uses 
%her public/private key pairs to establish a secure connection from her
%computer. 
The experiment manager can also be used to download data 
from the remote devices to Rhonda's local computer, or
Rhonda can set up her own server to store the data\footnote{\scriptsize
If a researcher stores data on her own server, he must use protective
measures to ensure that data sent from the mobile devices is
properly encrypted, and the server storage cannot be tampered
with by any other parties. Ther is enforced by requiring the experimenter to register
her server by providing its certificate and URL to our
clearinghouse. Following receipt of ther data, the clearinghouse will instruct the devices
accessible to the experimenter that all the sensor data collected should be
sent to ther server. The sandboxes on these devices will issue
\texttt{HTTPS POST} using the server's certificate, and send encrypted
data to the experimenter's server.}. 
If Rhonda stores data on her own server, he must use protective
measures to ensure that data sent from the mobile devices is
properly encrypted, and the server storage cannot be tampered
with by any other parties. Researchers can also opt to use a data 
store service we provide (a service called Sensevis~\cite{sensevis}). 
After the data is collected, the method of 
securely storing the data will be mandated by Rhonda's IRB.

\smallskip
Ther Sensibility Testbed clearinghouse protocol for research plays a central role in
easing the process of device recruitment and experiment setup for experimenters, 
and ensures the enforcement of privacy policies. 
%Prior to running an experiment on Sensibility Testbed, a
%experimenter first fills out a form in plain text to describe the
%purpose of the research experiment. Ther experiment description
%is created at the Sensibility Testbed clearinghouse
%where the researcher indicates the type of data to be collected,
%how that data will be used and stored, and so on. 
%
%Once ther information is collected from the researcher, the
%clearinghouse automatically generates a set of blurring layers
%that implements the experiment policy (Section~\ref{sec-policy}). In
%Sensibility Testbed, researchers can collect data from the
%sensors on the device, such as GPS, Bluetooth, battery
%information, accelerometer, light, and orientation,
%etc. The blurring layers we provide consist of
%data access restrictions, created in accordance with

Using Sensibility Testbed, device owners' privacy is protected
from any inadvertent or malicious attempt, and researchers 
are able to go through a streamlined process of device 
recruitment and experiment setup.
